Rainfall Prediction AppA simple web application built with Gradio to predict the likelihood of rainfall based on weather data. This project demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning model (Support Vector Classifier) into an interactive user interface.📋 DescriptionThis application takes key meteorological inputs and uses a trained Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model to predict whether it is likely to rain. The model was originally developed in a Jupyter Notebook and has been adapted for this user-friendly web app. The app has been simplified to use the four most influential features for prediction, making it quick and easy to use.✨ FeaturesInteractive UI: Simple and intuitive interface powered by Gradio.Real-time Prediction: Get instant rainfall predictions based on your input.Simplified Inputs: Uses the four most impactful weather features for prediction:SunshineHumidityCloud CoverPressure💾 DatasetThe model is trained on the Rainfall.csv dataset, which contains daily weather observations. This file is required to run the application as the model is trained in real-time when the script starts.🛠️ Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.PrerequisitesPython 3.7 or higherpip (Python package installer)InstallationSet up the project: Place rainfall_app.py, requirements.txt, and Rainfall.csv in the same directory.Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal within that directory:pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 How to Run the AppMake sure the Rainfall.csv file is in the same directory as rainfall_app.py.Run the application from your terminal:python rainfall_app.py
The terminal will display a local URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860). Open this URL in your web browser to use the app.🧠 Model DetailsModel: Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with an RBF kernel.Feature Scaling: StandardScaler is used to normalize the input features.Imbalance Handling: The training data is balanced using RandomOverSampler from the imbalanced-learn library to address the class imbalance in the original dataset.
